-- The piano should have at least two octaves of playable keys. 

-- It doesn't have to be fancy but should be easily recognizable as a piano. 

-- You should build it using react

-- The keys should be rendered in a dynamic way (not pre-arranged and positioned) 

-- Clicking the piano keys should play the appropriate midi notes or samples.

-- No need to support simultaneous key presses (No Polyphony) or consider the duration of the tone
